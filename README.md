# URL Shortener Fullstack Application

This repository houses a straightforward URL shortener Fullstack Application built with React and Node JS using TypeScript. It allows you to convert lengthy URLs into shorter, more shareable links.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

- Within this project, you'll find both the frontend and api services. The API Service resides in the `url-shortner-api-service` folder, while the Frontend Application can be located in the `url-shortner-frontend` folder.


### Installation and Usage
- Each of these services comes with its own comprehensive README, which provides detailed instructions for their installation processes and optimisation to consider.
-  API SERVICE README: https://github.com/sammyboardman/primarybid-tests/blob/master/url-shortner-api-service/README.md
-  FrontEnd SERVICE README: https://github.com/sammyboardman/primarybid-tests/blob/master/url-shortner-frontend/README.md

## Asumptions
- URLs with the same domain name but having distinct paths or subdomains are treated as separate and unique entities.
- Each identical URL will consistently produce the same shortened URL.
- This system assumes that the maximum number of shortened URLs that can be generated is limited to 4,294,967,296. If there is a need to generate more shortened URLs beyond this limit, it would necessitate a modification to the underlying algorithm, like increasing te length of the generated characters. Please note that this system was intentionally designed to be straightforward and highly efficient for typical use cases.
 - The regular expression used to validate input url ^(https?:\/\/)([a-zA-Z0-9.-]+(\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})+)(\/[^\s]*)?$ is designed to match URLs with certain criteria. Here are the criteria for a URL to pass this regex:
Protocol (http or https):
The URL must start with either "http://" or "https://".
Domain Name:
The domain name should consist of alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers), hyphens, and periods.
It must contain at least one period (dot).
It should have at least two letters following the last period to represent the top-level domain (TLD), such as ".com", ".org", ".net", etc.
Path (optional):
  The path is optional and starts with a forward slash "/".
  It can contain any characters except whitespace.
Here are some examples of URLs that would match this regex:
 1. http://www.example.com
 2. https://sub.domain.co/path/to/resource
 3. https://localhost
 4. http://127.0.0.1:8080/page

## Explaining the Algorithm for Generating Unique URL Shorteners
- The first 8 characters of a hash generated by a cryptographic hash function like SHA-256 are highly unique. Cryptographic hash functions are designed for uniform distribution of output values, making it exceptionally unlikely for two different inputs to produce the same hash (collision).

- In practice, the probability of two different inputs producing the same first 8 characters of a SHA-256 hash is exceedingly low. These 8 characters represent 32 bits of data (each hexadecimal character symbolizes 4 bits), and SHA-256 generates a 256-bit hash.

- The number of possible combinations for 32 bits is 2^32, which equals 4,294,967,296. This implies there are 4,294,967,296 potential unique values for the first 8 characters.

- While it is theoretically possible for a collision to occur (i.e., two different inputs producing the same first 8 characters), the likelihood of such an event is so minuscule that, in practice, it can be considered negligible for most purposes.
